This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of lists representing the Gann square of order `n`. The Gann square is a square grid of integers where the numbers are arranged in such a way that the sum of any row, column, or diagonal is the same. The Gann square of order 1 is simply the number 1.

The `if` statement checks if `n` is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns a list containing a single list with the number 1. Otherwise, the function recursively calls itself with `n-1` as the argument to generate the previous Gann square. It then calculates the new row and column for the current Gann square based on the previous Gann square, and initializes a new square with zeros. Finally, it fills in the new square with the values of the previous square and the new row and column, and returns the new square.

Note that this implementation assumes that `n` is a positive integer.
